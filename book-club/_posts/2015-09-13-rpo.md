Cosmic Owl got its start when two best friends with a love for building cool things came together and decided to build cool things together.

Nathan Ansel and Chase McCoy are two Computer Science students in Starkville, Mississippi with a penchant for good software. We are Apple fanboys, music aficionados, and design junkies.

Cosmic Owl is our creative outlet for a delightful combination of code and design. We look forward to making neat products and to working with interesting people. Please [get in touch](mailto:hi@cosmicowl.co) if you want to work with us.

We are just getting started.

â€” Nathan and Chase

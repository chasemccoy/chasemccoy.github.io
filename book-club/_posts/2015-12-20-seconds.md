The first graphic novel for this book club and probably not the last, Seconds is the latest book by the famous Brian Lee O'Malley. You probably know him from Scott Pilgrim vs. The World, and this newest work does not disappoint. The same humor and art style can be found in this book. There is an element of the superstitious in this title, but the characters totally accept it and I really liked it. I throughly enjoyed the whole book and I highly recommend it. It may only take a few hours to read, but it's very good.

Katie is a chef at a very popular restaurant, but she wants to open another one, one that she can truly call her own. Katie's life is in a great place, but all that changes when her ex-boyfriend shows up and her best waitress gets injured. Suddenly things go sour and then, out of nowhere, a second chance shows up. She has a notebook and a mushroom, and what happens next changes her entire life.

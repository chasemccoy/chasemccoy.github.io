After so much hype about this book and the upcoming movie, we decided to kick off the book club by reading *The Martian*.

If you don’t already know, *The Martian* is about the story of a NASA astronaut who gets stranded on Mars after his team is forced to evacuate early. Faced with certain doom and seemingly no hope of rescue, he is forced to rely on his wits to survive. 

This book was really great for a couple of reasons. The first was the unexpected sense of humor from the book’s protagonist. *The Martian* includes a lot of scientific explanations, and the humor really helped to keep it light and entertaining. Speaking of science, almost all of it in this book is accurate, which is really cool.

*The Martian* was a really quick, funny, and exciting book to read. I highly recommend it if you haven’t read it already.

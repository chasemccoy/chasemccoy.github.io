I picked this book because I had read it before and wanted to introduce Chase to it, but I found that the more I read the more I realized I had forgotten most of the story. It is a fantastic tale full of happiness, sadness, anger, and wonder. While it is the first of a trilogy, but works well as a stand-alone story.

Jack and his younger sister Lucy are captured and enslaved by a group of fierce warriors called the berserkers. They are taken to a world full of new people and experiences. This book is full of references to Norse mythology and Anglo Saxon legends that only lend to the story telling in the book. The characters are full of life, and the more you live with the enemies in the book the more you come to like them despite their terrible traditions.

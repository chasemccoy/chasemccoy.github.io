Jack and his younger sister Lucy are captured and enslaved by a group of fierce people named berserkers. They are taken to a new world, and undertake a wonderful adventure filled with Norse mythology. And the very last page in the book? Well it leads to a wonderful revelation that is guaranteed to make you smile.

This book is the first of a trilogy, but works well as a stand-alone story.

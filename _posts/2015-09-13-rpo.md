Two books were mega popular this summer: *The Martian* and *Ready Player One*. So after we finished up *The Martian* we moved on to *RPO*. 

Filled with tons of 1980’s pop-culture references, this book tells the story of a future when everyone on Earth escapes into a virtual reality game called the Oasis in order to avoid the slowly dying planet they live on. 

The founder of the Oasis recently died, and when he did he promised his vast riches to whoever could find all of the easter eggs he had hid inside the game. The protagonist of the book gets wrapped up in the hunt for the easter egg, and it has consequences in both the virtual and real worlds. 

Like *The Martian*, this book was a lot of fun to read. It was one that kept you on the edge of your seat, and it also had a great sense of humor. You will especially love this book if you have a lot of knowledge about 80’s video games/movies/TV/etc. But even if you don’t, I really think you will still find this book entertaining. Because it’s set largely in a virtual reality, there are so many rules that the author is allowed to break. And that makes for a very fun, exciting novel.

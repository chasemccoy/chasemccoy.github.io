    <p>Nox (latin for ‘night’) is the best app for quickly finding when the sun will set or rise at your current location. It can even alert you before a sunrise or sunset using customizable alerts. Plus, the today widget makes it even easier to quickly check the amount of daylight left. No internet connection required, super fast, and extremely simple.</p>
